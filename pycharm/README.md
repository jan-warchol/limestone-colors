Monochrome PyCharm
------------------

Monochrome theme for Pycharm. This is work in progress; currently there is
support for language elements of Python and JavaScript. Once the styling for
these settle, I'll add styling for:

- HTML, CSS
- XML, Yaml, Json
- search results
- code inspections (errors, warnings etc.)

Installation
------------

1. Download `.icls` file (clone the repo or click on the file, select `Raw` and save).
1. In Pycharm, go to `Settings` => `Editor` => `Color Scheme` => `Cog button` => `Import
   Scheme...` and select downloaded file.
